## What's included

* [PropTypes](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html)
* [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) with [redux-thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk) and [redux-persist](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist)
* [React native router flux](https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-router-flux)

#### How to start your own project

* Delete both `ios` and `android` folder. At this stage, those contains nothing that is not autogenerated.
* Change your app name in `app.json`, `package.json`, and `app/index.js`
* Run `react-native upgrade`. This will generate the native folders again.
* Run `npm run react-devtools` to open standalone react-devtools app

## Develop

##### iOS

Run command to open iOS simulator and run app:

```
$ npm run ios
```

Or open `ios/PrototypeJobs.xcodeproj` file with XCode:

```
$ npm run ios-open
```

##### Android (5.0+)

Open Android emulator and run:

```
$ npm run android
```


## Test
Test suit is using jest, to run the tests use:

```
$ npm test
```


## Release

Releases are done via fastlane to avoid having to wait 15 minutes to open either xcode or android studio.

* First start by [installing fastlane](https://docs.fastlane.tools/getting-started/ios/setup/).
* Then make sure you set iOS and Android profiles and keys following this [tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/running-on-device.html)

In the boilerplate, only beta release are configured

* For android, run `fastlane android beta`
* For ios, run `fastlane ios beta`
